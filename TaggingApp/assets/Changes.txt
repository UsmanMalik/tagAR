Current Version 2.1
Changes Since Version 2.0

A major bug was discovered and fixed in this version of the app. The bug was that if the user decided not to allow the
downloading and uploading of images associated with the tags, then the app should the please wait modal indefinitely until
the user himself cancelled by pressing the back button. This problem did not occur if the user decided to allow the app
to download and upload images.

Another change made was that, the app does not download and upload the images by default. The user can enable this feature 
in the Settings Page.

Some changes have been made to the server code as well to reflect the change and backward compatibility has been provided to
allow the apps of older version to function properly.
